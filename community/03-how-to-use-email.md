#### 4. Find your Apache email

You should have an email from `root@apache.org` like this in your mailbox:

* Titled `Welcome to the Apache Software Foundation`

* The content is as follows

  ```text
  Dear YYYY,
  Good news! We have created your Apache Software Foundation (ASF) committer account, and it is now ready for you.
  Your ApacheID is: xxxx
  ......
  ```

* Your Apache email is `xxxx@apache.org`

#### 5. Add Apache email
